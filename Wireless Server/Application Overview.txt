SERVER APPLICATION OVERVIEW

I used Multi-user TCP chat application as a template for developing printers’ server software. 

Printers’ server software consists of server application and client application. Server application was design to perform following functions:
-	Listen for active TCP connections initiated by printers
-	Accept TCP connections and start client application for each connection
-	Request print message number from connected printer through client application
-	Receive and analyze print message number and pass it to client application
-	Receive print message from client application and prepare it for sending to connected printer
-	Close connections
-	Handle events raised in client application
-	Handle errors
-	Provide visual display of system’s activity 

Client application was designed to perform following functions:
-	Send and receive data between application and connected printer
-	Build string from received bytes
-	Locate print message in database file and modify it if needed
-	Return print message to server application

These were parameters that could be changed if needed without modifications to the programming code. I collected these parameters into initialization text file. Printers’ server software contains code to read these parameters, which are:
-	Location of print message database file
-	Worksheet number of the Microsoft Excel file where print message database resigns
-	Location of logging text file
-	Text used as identifier for printing logos, special characters and sequential product length marks

And finally, printers’ server software contains code to record printers’ server network activity for future reference. This information is recorded in text file.
